## What Is a Crypto Wallet Drainer?

A crypto wallet drainer is a scam technique that tricks users into approving malicious blockchain transactions.  
Instead of stealing private keys, attackers exploit smart contract approval permissions to drain assets from a wallet.

These scams commonly target users on:
- Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains
- Solana
- Popular browser wallets and mobile wallets

## Why People Search for “Crypto Drainer Scripts” or “Wallet Drainer GitHub”

Many users search for phrases like “crypto drainer script”, “wallet drainer script”, or “crypto drainer GitHub” without realizing that:

## How Wallet Drainer Scams Actually Work (High-Level Overview)

Wallet drainer scams rely on social engineering, not technical hacking.

Common methods include:
- Fake NFT mint websites
- Malicious airdrop claim pages
- Impersonated Discord and Twitter links
- Phishing websites that request wallet connections

When a user approves a malicious transaction, the attacker gains permission to transfer tokens without needing private keys.

### EVM-Based Drainer Scams
On EVM chains, drainers exploit token approval mechanisms, allowing attackers to transfer assets once permission is granted.

### Solana Wallet Drainer Scams
Solana scams often rely on deceptive transaction signing rather than approvals, but the goal remains the same: unauthorized asset transfer.
